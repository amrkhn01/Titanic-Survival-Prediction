# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning.

## Project Overview
The sinking of the Titanic is a well-known historical event. This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on various features like age, gender, ticket class, and more.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers onboard the Titanic. This dataset is commonly used for introductory machine learning projects.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
    * Handling missing values (imputation).
    * Feature engineering (creating new features).
    * Encoding categorical features (one-hot encoding).
    * Feature scaling (standardization).
2. **Model Building:**
    * Logistic Regression was used for classification.
3. **Model Evaluation:**
    * Accuracy and classification report were used to assess model performance.

## Results
* The model achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test set.
